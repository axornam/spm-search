{"0": "Drone is classified as an aerial vehicle that does not carry a human operator, usesaerodynamic forces to provide vehicle lifts, can operate independently or remotely, canbe extended or recoverable, and can carry a lethal or non-lethal payload. It is operatedeither individually by on-board computers or by the pilot's remote control on theground. The goal of the Project is to develop and implement the drone for landsurveying and mapping applications, based on the open source Autopilot calledArdupilot framework. Drone flight controller system is simulated and built for landmapping purposes. The Drone control system is developed and simulated in MATLAB/Simulink. The simulation shows the built Drone being run and managed very stably.Microcontroller-based drone control system is also developed. In this case, the Droneused an RC transmitter and receiver for remote operation.Evidence from the literature review and research undertaken indicates that the use ofthe drones makes it possible to cover a wide variety of terrestrial and aerial approachesand that it can supplement or complement other means of surveying and data collection.The usage offers the ability to get close to the target without being stuck on the land, aswell as benefits from the operating environment, as risky, challenging environments canbe reached from a distance. Data can be obtained quicker, faster, easier and more often.Time savings exist at the calculation level, but more time is required for the post-processing of the data relative to terrestrial approaches", "1": "FARM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WITH MACHINE LEARNINGFarm Management is simply the science of optimizing the use of resources in the farm componentof farm-households, Farm management systems give farmers an instant overview of the day to dayweather forecast or yearly history for every field. Based on the farmers, farm management systemsmay differ from one farm to another, but the significant concern of farm management is the typeof farm. The system is designed for the particular need of the farmers to carry out operationssmoothly and effectively. In our system, there is a drone and a drone camera for surveillance offarmland, a web server which stores, processes and delivers web pages to the users, a databaseserver to store data from farmland and system and a weather API to allow access to current weatherdata on farmland. The drone camera after monitoring and obtaining live feeds from the systemtransmits the sensor data and video stream or image capture to the web socket server. Implementedin the system is a Mobile App written in Java and runs on the Android Platform and it provides alive camera feed of what the drone sees when mounted on the drone Platform. The quality of thevideo stream is highly dependent on the Camera Resolution of the Host device and also the qualityof the internet connection, however since a high priority is given to the smoothness of the feed,the system may intentionally degrade the quality of the video feed to maintain the frame rate. Italso provides you with the option of deploying your trained ML models to the cloud for inferenceand testing. The web portal offers an easy to use and intuitive interface for the workers andmanagers to manage operations on the farm. The system gives only two options to the end-userthat is: The Manager who oversees all farm activities and the Employee who is assigned a task towork on the farm. The farmer in the system has many tools to enable him to manage the farm withkeen attention while the employee is just assigned a task and sees to it that it is done. Now in theManager dashboard, the manager can have access to the Live Feeds, Disease Detection, Workersand Task tools. The farmer could use this functionality by just adding an image to the system andthen it detects the possibility of the diseases and also detects how healthy the cocoa pods are.However, the few images we used to train our model gave precise predictions andrecommendations. The images captured and used for system testing were good for the dronecamera due to the picture resolution of the mobile we used.", "2": "AbstractIn the current day situation, we mostly realize the overflow of waste in bins and trash cans atcertain unexpected places especially residential areas. Waste continues to spill over day by day inthese places because of the higher rate of expansion of residential areas. Our population isdefinitely proportional to the amount of waste generated and this accounts for the rapid generationof waste in residential areas.Based on research conducted by Quartz Africa, there has been an indication that, while wastemanagement is a widespread issue in Ghana, Accra seems to be the most affected city creatingfrom about 2,000 to 3,000 metric tonnes of waste within 24 hours. In 2012, the World Bankevaluated that the fall in Ghana's economy was due to poor sanitation. [1]Given this, we intend to propose a unified system of both software and hardware that is based onthe concept of eliminating all these issues by enabling anyone to dispose of their trash at any pointof time at their convenience. The software i.e., the mobile app would have a customer and a driveraspect where the customer can schedule or order for immediate garbage pickup at any time. Itwould make use of Global Positioning System (GPS) to enable real time tracking of the locationof the connected pickup driver. [2]Here, the customer would be connected to a nearby user who has already signed up as a driver onthe app and is currently online. One can also have a real-time feed of the driver's location as heapproaches the customer. Another phase of this project aims at aiding individuals to keep track ofthe garbage levels in their cans and bins by introducing an IT hardware system. The deviceconsists of an ultrasonic sensor, an Arduino UNO, and a Wi-Fi module that would communicateto servers and give feedback to the mobile app. Fairly, everything that happens on the hardwarephase is subsequently shown in the software thus, the percentage of rubbish in the bin is displayedin the mobile app.This is what our project seeks to do to curb the problem and to ensure a safe and healthyenvironment."}
