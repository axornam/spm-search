[{"introduction": "BackgroundRash driving, also known as reckless driving, is a traffic violation where an individualwilfully drives in a manner that shows disrespect for the traffic rules that be and putshimself/herself and other road users at risk [1]. According to Colley(A Law Firm in theUSA), there are five (5) main types of reckless driving - speeding, distracted driving,disregard of traffic signals, street racing, and aggressive driving [2]. For the purpose ofthis project, we decided to focus on speeding. This is because that was the only feasibleoption, considering the allowed time frame for this project work, available technologyand financial resources.Speeding is the act of driving faster than is allowed by law in a particular geographicalarea [31. The main aim of this project is to build an integrated system that helps membersof the appropriate regulatory bodies (preferably the Ghana Police) to find and properlysanction road users who tend to defy the law. This system has three (3) main parts - AnEmbedded System, A Server-side API and a client-facing application. The embeddedsystem was built with a camera to serve as a real-time surveillance tool for the state.Videos will be taken of passer-by cars at regular intervals. The computer vision algorithmon the embedded system is responsible for detecting the speed levels of each car that isseen in the video. If a vehicle is realized to be speeding, the car number of that vehicle isextracted and sent to the server-side API for storage and sanctioning. The purpose of theserver-side API is to provide a record of offenders and also the sanctions owed by them.It also interfaces with the client-facing web application that serves as an avenue forauthorized users to update offender records after payment of outstanding sanctions.", "abstract": "Rash Driving Detection System Using Computer VisionThe primary aim of this project is to develop an embedded system that employs imageand video processing algorithms to detect vehicular speeds and flag vehicles that arefound to be moving at speeds greater than the allowed speed limits within specifiedgeographical locations. Vehicles that are flagged for speeding will have relevant detailsextracted from their number plates and sent to the appropriate authorities (the GhanaPolice Service). The final product of this project will go a long way to reduce the numberof road accidents that plague our roads by serving as a driver-conduct regulatorymechanism on our roads.According to City News Room, the government of Ghana loses an approximate amountof $233M every year due to road accidents. It is clear that these road accidents do notonly cost human life but also substantial amounts of money.This project is aimed at building an embedded system that will be placed on our roads totake frequent videos of cars that pass within the line of sight of the camera. These videoswill be initially pre-processed and passed through a computer vision algorithm thatdetects the speed of each vehicle. If a vehicle is found to be speeding, the algorithmextracts the car number from the number plate of the car in question and sends it to anAPI(Application Programming Interface) managed by the appropriate government body(the Ghana Police Service). The API then applies monetary sanctions to the registeredowner of the car which he/she has to pay in order to be able to renew important documentslike roadworthy license and driver's license. This will also serve as another revenue-generating avenue for the state. This system will be hereafter referred to as \"Maakye wo\"a Fante phrase that means \u00abyou've been caught\".The Coronavirus pandemic rendered it possible to obtain some needed parts for thesystem and as such the hardware system could not be fully realized. Upon testing of thesystem, we were able to flag speeding vehicles and charge the registered owners.Further work can be done on this in the future. This could include the addition of moretraffic rules such as lane jumping, wrongful overtaking and disregard of traffic signals.1VUndergraduate Thesis - Department of Computer Engineering, 2020", "document": "", "image": "http://full-spm-api.herokuapp.com/public/uploads/image_picker7698245258515807072-1649259554478.jpg", "images": [], "rating": 0, "numReviews": 0, "_id": "624db429b461030023f4d46d", "name": "A RASH DRIVING DETECTION SYSTEM USING COMPUTERVISION SEDEM OUAME AMEKPEWU  INDEX NUMBER:10622243 SAMUEL KOBINA OBENG ANDAM  INDEX NUMBER:10627711", "description": "A RASH DRIVING DETECTION SYSTEM USING COMPUTERVISION", "author": "sedem@gmail.com", "category": {"_id": "620fe0d51dde1f957ff1749d", "name": "software", "icon": "keyboard", "color": "blue", "__v": 0, "id": "620fe0d51dde1f957ff1749d"}, "dateCreated": "2022-04-06T15:39:21.312Z", "__v": 0, "id": "624db429b461030023f4d46d"}, {"introduction": "Farm Management, making and executing the choices included in organising and working acultivar for the greatest generation and benefit[1].

The management system suitable forone farm may give unsatisfactory results to another farm.In areas where the manager of farms has a small farm with ample labor, limited capital, and a fewacres of land often faces an acute capital-land management problem.

In our system, there is a drone and a drone camera for surveillance offarmland, a web server which stores, processes and delivers web pages to the users, a databaseserver to store data from farmland and system and a weather API to allow access to current weatherdata on farmland. The drone camera after monitoring and obtaining live feeds from the systemtransmits the sensor data and video stream or image capture to the web socket server. Implementedin the system is a Mobile App written in Java and runs on the Android Platform and it provides alive camera feed of what the drone sees when mounted on the drone Platform. The quality of thevideo stream is highly dependent on the Camera Resolution of the Host device and also the qualityof the internet connection, however since a high priority is given to the smoothness of the feed,the system may intentionally degrade the quality of the video feed to maintain the frame rate. Italso provides you with the option of deploying your trained ML models to the cloud for inferenceand testing. The web portal offers an easy to use and intuitive interface for the workers andmanagers to manage operations on the farm. The system gives only two options to the end-userthat is: The Manager who oversees all farm activities and the Employee who is assigned a task towork on the farm. The farmer in the system has many tools to enable him to manage the farm withkeen attention while the employee is just assigned a task and sees to it that it is done. Now in theManager dashboard, the manager can have access to the Live Feeds, Disease Detection, Workersand Task tools. The farmer could use this functionality by just adding an image to the system andthen it detects the possibility of the diseases and also detects how healthy the cocoa pods are.However, the few images we used to train our model gave precise predictions andrecommendations.

Drones are moreformally known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or unmanned aircraftsystems (UASs). Essentially, a drone is a flying robot that can be remotelycontrolled or fly autonomously through software-controlled flight plans in theirembedded system, working in conjunction with onboard sensors and GPS.Drones are now also used in a wide range of civilian roles ranging from searchand rescue, surveillance, traffic monitoring, weather monitoring, and firefighting,to personal drones and business drone-based photography, as well as videography,agriculture, and even delivery services. We developed a drone control systemwhich maps a land. Our system is capable of switching drone control between theRaspberry Pi and a handheld radio controller as well as switching between hoverand autonomous flight where the drone follows a red target underneath it. As thedecision-making unit, the Raspberry Pi 3 is used to read data from multiplesensors and monitor outputs from a chip to the onboard flight controller using arelay. The method of making observations from images is 3D imaging, known asphotogrammetry mapping. The picture software's output usually consists of a 3Dmap, a 3D drawing or a 3D model with some real object or landmass.

There is an increasing demand forgood education institutions to monitor student attendance. Consequently, education institutions areconstantly urged to record and report attendance data in a standard manner to allow comparisonsacross organizations and jurisdictions[1].The key factor in high-quality education is the relationship between attendance and studentachievement[2]. Even though it has been proven by research that student educational successhighly depends on tutor input or influence, chronic absenteeism will reduce the ability of even thebest teacher to provide ideal learning opportunities for students. Consequently, students who attendclass more frequently tend to achieve more than students who do not[3].Attendance data can be used in many ways to make record management more efficient and can beanalyzed to deduce trends and information that can be used in improving education or other sectorsnot related to education. For instance, linking absenteeism data with teacher performance data,student grades and performance can help identify factors that improve and hinder student success.Also, attendance data can be analyzed with other non-educational data to deduce usefulinformation. For instance, it may be useful to analyze the relationship between attendance andclimate in an area to determine how the climate affects student attendance, and consequently, theirperformance.1.0.2 Potential usesThough our project focused on taking and managing attendance records for schools and othereducational institutions, this project can easily be used in workplaces and other similar institutionsfor keeping emplovee attendance records.

While research affirmsthe significance of teacher effectiveness on student academic performance, even the most efficientteachers cannot impact learning if students are not present in class physically or remotely.As the importance of attendance have been stated, the means of recording or tracking of attendingdata is also a key issue. Attendance records are traditionally taken by passing a sheet of paper inclass or mentioning student names and marking responses in a register. This can take too muchtime and effort depending on class size, moreover, the reliability of the papers or registers isquestionable.Face recognition is gradually becoming a very prolific and efficient way of identificationnowadays. It is being adopted by many top companies like Apple, Samsung, Microsoft foridentification and verification of users. We chose to utilize face recognition as a key tool in creatinga more efficient, faster, and highly autonomous attendance record system. Also, by using RFIDtechnology as a supporting tool, we aim to reduce the deficits of face recognition to a minimum.By coupling face recognition and RFID technology we were able to create a better attendancemanagement system that is not only faster and more efficient but also generates and storeselectronic records which is more reliable and easier to perform analysis on.On implementation and testing, we deduced that have more images per person as the dataset,preprocessing images (realigning faces with dib) and tweaking parameters improves positiverecognition rates. Also, some factors like lightning, eyewear, etc. affect both detection andrecognition.

Invasions in these sectors are rapidly increasing.Homes, facilities and business security is a major concern, since every homeowner or facilityowner wants to protect their properties from burglars, armed robbers or any intruders or in short;crime. These owners don't want to just protect their properties; they also want to prevent potentialbreak-ins, destructions and loss of life [1]. Everyone is different which means everyone can beaffected differently or relate differently when they are exposed to crime. Crime can be severe; mostpeople don't suffer any long-term harm. On some occasions, people may develop long-termproblems, such as depression or anxiety-related illnesses, and some people also have severe, long-lasting conditions after a crime is experienced, known as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)[2]. Thankfully there are security systems available that can be installed at homes or industries, toprotect properties from burglars or criminals.Security systems can be defined as systems that detect possible intrusion or unauthorizedentries, by burglars, armed robbers and sometimes assailants. These systems are used at homes,commercial, industries, schools, residential areas and military for protection against burglary ordamage of property, as well as personal protection against intruders [3]. Some security systemsare designed to detect fire or any other hazards. The present system designed, which is the smartintrusion detection, alarm and alert system, focuses on intruders. Most of the security systems usesensors to detect the presence of intruders. They also include alarm devices such as loud speakersor buzzers, that make noise when an intruder is detected. A car alarm system is an example ofsystems that use sensors. These sensors can be integrated into the doors, trunk, and hood of a car,and they allow the control unit to detect whenever someone tries to open anything up to gain accessto the vehicle [4]. With this and many other ways to detect intruders, burglars fail or attempt notto break into buildings.Protection and security of people and properties have always been an important topic. Withthe evolution of technology, the function and capabilities of security systems have also evolved.The concept of burglar alarms dates back thousands of years to a time when dogs were used to", "abstract": "This report contains a proposed system that will ensure that the welfare of the facilities of usersare ensured. Smart intrusion detection, alarm and alert system detects intruders in a facility orhome and sets off an alarm while alerting the owners of the system. To ensure that no false alarmis set off, a facial recognition algorithm is implemented in the system. This facial recognition isachieved using computer vision and machine learning.Robberies are common problems in places where security systems are unavailable. Facilities andhomeowners who have been attacked before, or are victim to such attacks know how terrible itfeels, to discover that someone has broken into your home and stolen your money or properties. Itis important to make people know that such problems can be reduced or be prevented by installingsecurity systems at their homes or facilities, to protect their properties and also prevent potentialbreak-ins by burglars; hence the need for this project.Designing a smart intrusion detection system that can set off an alarm and also alert the ownersof homes remotely, can solve the problem stated above. This system uses a facial recognitionsystem to prevent false alarm. Most systems set off false alarms and this can be a problem. Thesystem also has a Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor to detect the presence of intruders.There are lots of security systems on the market of which most aren't affordable by the averageindividual. Some are easy to install and some are quite the opposite. Some of the systems are lesslikely to prevent false alarm since what they mostly do is detect motion and set off an alarm. Thesystem we have designed is easy to install and very affordable.The system protects valuables, allows remote access to the system, notifies if there's an intrusionand it also helps you keep your mind at peace.

Waste continues to spill over day by day inthese places because of the higher rate of expansion of residential areas.

These innovations been implemented on alarge scale in many countries and continents around the world. In many African countries, thejourney of fully adopting these innovations is still in its early days. Among the recentinnovations tackling the provision of broadband internet to rural areas is TVWS. TVWS is anemerging concept that was realized while studying the effective management of TV spectrumin various regions around the World. In Ghana, the migration of TV stations to digitalbroadcasting in recent years has unveiled research towards the implementation of TVWS inthe TV band to tackle the problems of internet access in the country on a large scale. This thesispresents the definition of a propagation model that best describes the path loss measured fromTVWS communication network per distance in Accra using the University of Ghana as a casestudy. In this study, @ TVWS network was setup and demonstrated the use of a Geo-locationDatabase for the assignment of operating channels to avoid interference. A management systemwas implemented for the regulatory body of the TVWS resource and the operation alongsidethe Geo-location database was demonstrated. The network performance was analyzed atvarious periods of time and through various channel frequency bands to understand the effectof geographical features and environmental conditions on the network. Also signal strengthmeasurements were performed at a number of locations in the area of study and the path losswas deduced from these measurements per distance. Finally, a proposed propagation modeldescribing the nature of TVWS network in the area of study is realized though statistical andcomparative analysis.", "document": "", "image": "http://full-spm-api.herokuapp.com/public/uploads/image_picker6568848565595530753-1649278105322.jpg", "images": [], "rating": 0, "numReviews": 0, "_id": "624dfc9cf49988002311f777", "name": "DEFINING A PROPAGATION MODEL FOR TVWS USE In ACCRA ANTHONIO CEPHAS DELALI - 10671279.

With this in view, the need for high performing data networking systems is on therise than ever before. Optical fiber provides us with the needed bandwidth and speed to achievethis. However, the implementation of these installations is a very challenging task in itself.Development of other servicing channels such as water pipelines and electric cables means thatthe planning and design of these optic pathways are to be tactful and precise. This has not been thecase, more so the country. Unmethodical planting of fiber cables spells out great consequences,contributing towards inhibiting the steady development of a nation. Naturally, measures haveplaced to curb this but mismanagement of funds and inadequate public broadcast has made resultsunyielding.This project presents an investigation intothe route design and analysis of fiberarchitectures, taking into account aerial and underground installments. This involved the use ofscientifically appropriate procedures, along with implementation, examination and gathering ofresults for validation. In our project, we realized to an extent, optimum structural design andadministration of the backend framework of fiber systems. A high-level design was produced,following technical site surveying to which a low-level design is produced.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), COVID-19 is spreadbetween infected people through close contact and the most effective way to reduce thetransmission of the virus is social distancing. This project seeks to design and developinnovative technological approaches through Bluetooth technology and computer vision toensure compliance with the social distancing protocol.A mobile application was designed that uses Bluetooth technology to track the distancebetween the user and surrounding devices within the range of 1 metre. The mobile applicationscans for any Bluetooth device nearby and upon detection, calculates the distance between theuser's phone and the identified device. Once the device is near the user of the application, theapplication alerts the user in the form of vibrations and sound. Testing of the designed mobileapplication shows that the application can detect devices within the 1 metre range and carryout the necessary alerts as specified by the user.A computer vision system was also developed to monitor the social distance compliance levelamong people. This system leverages the OpenCV library and Deep learning based on YOLOtraining datasets. Data frames from a camera feed are fed into the system and the systemidentifies people in the frames and performs a pairwise distance estimation. Upon violationdetection, the images are sent to an administrator to view the violations that occurred. Testingshows that the system has a high accuracy of detecting people and performing distanceestimation between pairs. It also shows that the images and violations are successfully sent tothe administrator for monitoring.The performance of the proposed solutions shows that by leveraging technology, socialdistancing can be adhered to, reducing the transmission of COVID-19.", "document": "", "image": "http://full-spm-api.herokuapp.com/public/uploads/image_picker5865665139977278192-1649281445873.jpg", "images": [], "rating": 0, "numReviews": 0, "_id": "624e09aaf49988002311f79d", "name": "ENFORCING SOCIAL DISTANCING USING BLUETOOTH AND COMPUTER VISION CEPHAS NII AYITTEY HAMMOND (10673309)  EMMANUEL AMOAH NANA ADJEI (10663876) AHORNAM AGBOTSE (10684204)", "description": "ENFORCING SOCIAL DISTANCING USING BLUETOOTH AND COMPUTER VISION", "author": "hammon@aol.cOM", "category": {"_id": "620fe0d51dde1f957ff1749d", "name": "software", "icon": "keyboard", "color": "blue", "__v": 0, "id": "620fe0d51dde1f957ff1749d"}, "dateCreated": "2022-04-06T21:44:10.011Z", "__v": 0, "id": "624e09aaf49988002311f79d"}]
